# HTML-CSS-Bootstrap-Workshop

💻 About the Project

🔹 Project Overview

This project is a responsive multi-section website created as part of a web development workshop.
It focuses on designing a clean, modern, and interactive user interface using only frontend technologies — HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap — without any backend frameworks.

The goal was to learn and demonstrate core web design principles, including layout structuring, responsiveness, and user experience.

🔹 Technologies Used

HTML5 → for structuring the webpage content.

CSS3 → for custom styling, animations, and hover effects.

Bootstrap 5 → for responsive layout, prebuilt components, and grid system.

🔹 Key Features

✨ Responsive Design — The layout adapts smoothly to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens using Bootstrap’s grid system.
🎨 Interactive Cards — Cards with hover effects (background color change, shadows, button gradients).
🌈 Animated Elements — Smooth text animations (e.g., moving text from bottom to top).
🖱️ Hover Effects — Button color gradients and box shadows enhance interactivity.
📸 Image Carousel — Auto-sliding carousel to showcase images or content dynamically.
🧭 Navigation Bar — A fully responsive navbar with Bootstrap, collapsing into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.

🔹 Learning Outcomes
